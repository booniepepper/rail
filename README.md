# Rail

A straightforward programming language.

Rail is an experimental [concatenative](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language)
programming language. It is under wild development and zero stability between
versions is guaranteed.

```
$ railsh
rail 0.21.1

> 1 1 + print
2

> [ [ n ] -> n print " " print n 2 * ] "print-and-double" def

> 1 [ print-and-double ] 7 times
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 

> [ [ false ] [ "bye" ] [ true ] [ "hi" ] ] opt println
hi
```
